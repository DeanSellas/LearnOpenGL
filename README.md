# LearnOpenGL
Because I have not worked with a Graphics API in a while and want to restart my Game Engine project I decided to begin from scratch and learn OpenGL using the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/) tutorials.

If you want to see my code and follow along with the progress just clone the repository and use premake5.

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/DeanSellas/LearnOpenGL`

## Blog
I will document my progress here...

### GLFW
Because I wanted to use premake instead of cmake, I created a fork of the GLFW repository and added `premake.lua` file to it. The repo can be found [here](https://github.com/DeanSellas/glfw)

## Requirements
* [premake5](https://premake.github.io/)
* OpenGL compatible GPU
* Any GLFW and GLAD requirements
